Aa-TTS  -For Roman language Text To Speech (TTS) engines words are mapped to phonetic engine. But for all  [Brahmic script](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmic_family_of_scripts) Indian languages, TTS engine can be made based on concatenative speech synthesis where every letter of word can be directly mapped  to it's sound.As, Many Indian languages have same letter set in both vowels and consonants with exception to few languages,giving the advantage of generalizing TTS engine to all Indian languages. Aa-TTS is all about making a common TTS for all Indian languages understanding their common patterns. This project is started in [DAIICT](http://www.daiict.ac.in) in 2005 where it has been implemented and tested for Telugu in academic setting with taking very few voice samplings.We intend to take very large number of voice samplings and make a generic engine which can translate text for all Brahimic family of scripts into contextual speech.
